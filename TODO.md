- [x] refactor evaluation loop
- [x] fix data consumption

# data
- [x] gaussian elimination
- [x] 1 variable linear equations
- [x] tokenizer
- [x] dataset with (x, y) pairs
- [x] embedding
- [x] data pipe

# deep learning
- [x] transformer 
- [x] training loop
- [x] positional embedding
- [x] evaluation loop
- [x] enhance training (adaptive model checkpoints, visualization, add more function arguments)
- [x] train and test accuracy (scatter plots)
- [x] add accelerator support
- [ ] connect to paperspace.com or colab.research.google.com

# debugging
- [x] use random seed
